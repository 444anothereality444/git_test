    <ul>   
        <li>Why you should use Linux or BSD OSs</li>
        <p>Linux and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution" target="_blank">*BSD</a> operating systems are based on <a href="https://unix.org/what_is_unix.html" target="_blank">unix</a>.
        According to <a href=https://w3techs.com/technologies/comparison/os-linux,os-windows" target="_blank"> w3techs</a>, internet is ruled by more than 55% of its servers running with Linux* vs 11% with Windows. Using Linux or 
        BSD as an operating system has at least two advantages. First, in order to use your system, you WILL have to learn commands that are also used in servers*. Also note that starting with no 
        DE* will make it easier for you to learn since all of your commands*  will be typed directly into the terminal*. Secondly, you will have to configure your
        operating system and especially your network*. With only these two elements in mind, you will be able to swim.</p>
        <li>BSD</li>
        <p> I am not used to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution" target="_blank">BSD</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution" target="_blank">official BSD</a>, 
        but it is a simplier and more concistent Linux. See openBSD* and FreeBSD*. Much of linux* tricks from this page will work on BSD bases. Not sure. But maybe...</p>
        <li>Linux</li>
        <p>Linux, sometimes called "GNU/Linux" by some weird people*, is the operating system that you want because you can do what you want with it. It can be a mail
        server or an usable operating to just surf on the net.
        <li>Commands</li>
        <li>weird people</li>
        <p>1- There are some distributions that don't use GNU tools, see Alpine* linux.</p>
